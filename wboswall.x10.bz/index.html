				<h2>Lesson 1</h2>
					<p><a href="exercise1/index.html">Exercise 1</a> Books n' Beans Original version</p>
				<h2>Exercise 1 Analysis</h2>
					<p>I have learned a great deal in building this website for Books n' Beans</p>
					<ul>
						<li>I have learned to properly set set up a website that will not only render properly but also aesthetically pleasing when viewing its source page.  When a website's or web page's code is neat and concise, it is rather easy to fix issues (using the W3C validator) or to further expand the website.</li>
						<li>How to properly use unordered and ordered lists.</li>
						<li>How to use header tags, paragraph tags.</li>
						<li>How to use the anchor tag: <a href="/index.html">Home page</a>.</li>
						<li>How to properly use the anchor tag to display other websites' content in a new tab.  For example <li><a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/weather/prince-edward-island/dunstaffnage"target="_blank">The Weather Network Forecast for My Community</a>.This is to help keep the website separate from the outside content of other websites.</li>
						<li>How to acquire a website domain and setting up a required hosting account so the website content can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.
						<li>How to then upload website files and folders to my hosting platform domain. Also to properly organize the files in their appropriate folders so maintaining the website is efficient so necessary updates are delivered with ease.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I look forward in creating my own website in the not-to-distant-future. But careful planning of website, what my domain will be and do compare prices and features between some Canadian hosting companies.</p>
				<h2>Exercise 2 Analysis</h2>
					<p><a href="exercise2/index.html">Exercise 2</a> Books n' Beans website Version 2.0</p>
					<p>I did find that having the hexadecimal colour codes in capitals is easy to read for me. I had to make a few tweaks to the colour for the unordered and ordered lists because they seemed to blend into the background color.  After making a slight CSS change, I found they stood out more and were easier to read than before. After looking at the finished website of Books n' Beans.  It does look nice and easier to read but I believe that no website is finished it always needs to updated to make sure the aesthetics and information is updated to keep the website current.  Most importantly for visitors to keep coming back!</p>
				<h2>Exercise 3 Analysis</h2>
					<p><a href="exercise3/index.html">Exercise 3</a> Books n' Beans website Version 3.0</p>
					<p>I am finding that as I finish each lesson it is all making sense. It can be frustrating getting the right CSS style for a website but that's where breaks come in handy to help me clear my head and come back with some new ideas to try until one or some of them work out.  It's all about celebrating the small achievemnts and not letting things get to me.</p>
				<h2>Reflections on Lesson 1</h2>
					<p>I enjoyed this lesson as it helps me create a good foundation to further learn more about creating and developing websites and web pages.</p>
				<h2>Reflections on Lesson 2</h2>
					<p>I did struggle with this exercise but I struggling with some personal problems which didn't any.  Aside from that, I found that I am pretty picky with colours and fonts to name a few.</p>
				<h2>Reflections on Lesson 3</h2>
					<p>I found the CSS box model to be helpful when it comes to correct margins and padding to a site.  If finding that the CSS styles are not great then simply resetting it helps to start over again.  Overall did enjoy this lesson.</p>

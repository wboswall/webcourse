		</ul>
	<h2>Exercise 1 Analysis</h2>
		<p>I have learned a great deal in building this website for Books n' Beans. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>I have learned to properly set set up a website that will not only render properly but also asthetically pleasing when viewing its source page.  When a website's or webpage's code is neat and consise, it is rather easy to fix issues (using the W3C validator) or to futher expand the website.</li>
				<li>How to properly use unordered and ordered lists.</li>
				<li>How to use header tags, paragraph tags.</li>
				<li>How to use the anchor tag: <a href="/index.html">Home page</a>.</li>
				<li>How to properly use the anchor tag to display other websites' content in a new tab.  For example <li><a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/weather/prince-edward-island/dunstaffnage"target="_blank">The Weather Network Forecast for My Community</a>.This is to help keep the website separate from the outside content of other websites.</li>
				<li>How to accquire a website domain and setting up a required hosting account so the website content can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.
				<li>How to then upload website files and folders to my hosting platform domain. Also to properly organize the files in their appropriate folders so maintaining the website is efficient so necessary updates are delivered with ease.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I look forward in creating my own website in the not-to-distant-future. But careful planning of website, what my domain will be and do compare prices and features between some Canadian hosting companies.</p>

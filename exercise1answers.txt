For part 1 of the assignment, I did get along just fine once I started the assignment and took my time building the index.html page and other subsequent html pages.  Also took time in testing them after to make sure that each page and it's external links rendered perfectly as expected.  
I also decided to further practice on what I learned in lesson 1 by creating my own website (http://wboswall.x10.bz/) through x10 hosting platform  that I found through lesson 1 videos.  The x10 hosting platform was transparent and really easy to set up a website unlike the other ones on the handout that didn't directly show on how to obtain a free hosting domain instead they were looking to sell a domain to me.  
After I hand some fun updating my website and adding my polished lesson 1 and exercise 1 web pages and posting links on the main page.  
It's amazing and rewarding in seeing a website that I created being live or local and is rendering correctly in the browser.
